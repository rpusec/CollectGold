# CollectGold

This is a small game I did as a final project in SignalR, I used C# for the serverside and Javascript for the client side. 
In order to run the game, you'll need Microsoft Visual Studio.  

Gameplay
-------------

The gameplay is pretty straight forward: collect as much <b>gold</b> as you possibly can, the <b>player</b> who collects the most <b>gold</b> wins. 

To move the character around the world, use the <b>arrow keys</b>. 

There's also a time limit in the game - the game ends after about a minute, afterwards the highscore frame is displayed. 

It is also possible to chat with other players using the <b>chat menu</b> on the right.
